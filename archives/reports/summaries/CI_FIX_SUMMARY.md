# CI/CD Fix Summary

## Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:

1. "Failed to initialize container qdrant/qdrant:latest"
2. "No files were found with the provided path: coverage.xml htmlcov/ .coverage"

## Root Causes

1. **Qdrant Container Issues**: The container was not starting properly in GitHub Actions
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: Tests were missing PYTHONPATH and other critical env vars
3. **Coverage Report Failures**: Tests failing prevented coverage report generation

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Qdrant Service Configuration (`.github/workflows/qdrant-qa.yml`)

- Changed from `qdrant:latest` to `qdrant:v1.15.1` (pinned version for consistency)
- Added environment variables for Qdrant configuration
- Added gRPC port (6334) in addition to HTTP port (6333)
- Increased health check timeouts and retries
- Improved health check logic to try multiple endpoints

### 2. Added Missing Environment Variables

Added to all test runs:

- `PYTHONPATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/src`
- `TESTING: true`
- `CI: true`

### 3. Improved Coverage Report Generation

- Added error handling to pytest command with `|| { ... }`
- Added coverage file verification step before upload
- Ensured artifacts are uploaded even if tests fail with `if: always()`

### 4. Enhanced Docker Compose Handling (`.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml`)

- Added `docker compose pull` before starting services
- Increased wait timeout from 60s to 90s
- Added service health verification with retries
- Added debugging output if services fail to start

### 5. Created Testing Utilities

- `test_qdrant_ci.py`: Simple script to test Qdrant connectivity
- `.github/workflows/test-qdrant-simple.yml`: Minimal workflow to test Qdrant setup

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: All steps now handle failures gracefully
2. **Improved Debugging**: Added extensive logging and status checks
3. **Consistent Configuration**: Aligned Qdrant versions across workflows
4. **Robust Health Checks**: Multiple retry attempts with different endpoints

## Testing

The changes can be tested by:

1. Running the simple test workflow: `.github/workflows/test-qdrant-simple.yml`
2. Pushing changes to trigger the full CI pipeline
3. Using the `test_qdrant_ci.py` script locally

## Expected Outcome

With these changes, the CI/CD pipeline should:

- Successfully start the Qdrant container
- Run all tests with proper environment configuration
- Generate coverage reports even if some tests fail
- Upload artifacts for debugging purposes
