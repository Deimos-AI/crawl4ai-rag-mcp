# Docker Compose Consolidation Summary

## Overview

Successfully consolidated Docker Compose files from 5 files to 3 standalone configurations.

## Before

- `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development overrides (extended base)
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Standalone test configuration
- `docker-compose.qdrant.yml` - Obsolete Qdrant configuration
- `docker-compose-test-qdrant.yml` - Obsolete test overrides

## After

### 1. `docker-compose.prod.yml` (Production)

- **Purpose**: Production deployment with security, monitoring, and performance optimizations
- **Key Features**:
  - Production-grade resource limits and reservations
  - Security hardening with `no-new-privileges` and capability drops
  - Comprehensive health checks with longer intervals
  - Nginx reverse proxy for SSL termination
  - Prometheus monitoring integration
  - Production logging configuration
  - API key authentication for services
  - Enterprise Neo4j edition support

### 2. `docker-compose.dev.yml` (Development)

- **Purpose**: Local development with hot-reload, debugging, and minimal resources
- **Key Features**:
  - Hot-reload support with Docker watch mode
  - Debug ports exposed (5678 for Python debugger)
  - Source code volume mounts
  - Reduced resource limits for laptop development
  - Debug logging enabled
  - Mailhog for email testing
  - All ports bound to localhost only for security
  - Python cache volume for faster restarts

### 3. `docker-compose.test.yml` (Test)

- **Purpose**: Automated testing environment for CI/CD
- **Key Features**:
  - Minimal resource usage
  - Fixed versions for consistency
  - Test-specific configurations
  - Health checks optimized for faster startup
  - Test runner service with profile support
  - Isolated test network
  - No auto-restart policy

## Makefile Updates

- Updated to support three separate environments
- Added production-specific commands (`make prod`, `make prod-down`, etc.)
- Made service commands interactive to choose environment
- Maintained backward compatibility with aliases
- Added environment selection for build, shell, and python commands

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Each file has a clear, single purpose
2. **Independence**: No file dependencies or inheritance
3. **Optimization**: Each environment is optimized for its use case
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
5. **Security**: Production has proper security hardening
6. **Performance**: Resource limits appropriate for each environment

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Development
make dev              # Start development with watch mode
make dev-bg-nobuild   # Start development without rebuilding

# Production
make prod             # Start production environment
make prod-down        # Stop production environment

# Testing
make docker-test-up   # Start test environment
make test-all         # Run all tests
```

## Removed Files

- `docker-compose.yml` - Replaced by docker-compose.prod.yml
- `docker-compose.qdrant.yml` - Obsolete, Qdrant included in all configs
- `docker-compose-test-qdrant.yml` - Obsolete, merged into test config
