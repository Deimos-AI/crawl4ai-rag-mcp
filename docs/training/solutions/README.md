## How to Use These Solutions

### Learning Approach

1. **Attempt First**: Try completing each exercise before looking at solutions
2. **Compare Approaches**: Compare your implementation with the provided solutions
3. **Understand Patterns**: Focus on understanding the testing patterns, not just the code
4. **Experiment**: Modify the solutions to explore different approaches
5. **Apply**: Use these patterns in your own projects

### Code Organization

Each solution includes:

- **Complete Implementation**: Full working code with all test methods
- **Detailed Explanations**: Commentary on why specific approaches were chosen
- **Best Practices**: Highlighted patterns and conventions
- **Common Issues**: Pitfalls to avoid and their solutions
- **Advanced Patterns**: More sophisticated techniques for experienced developers

### Running the Solutions

```bash
# Navigate to exercises directory
cd docs/training/exercises

# Create the implementation files from the exercise descriptions
# (Copy the code blocks into the appropriate files)

# Run specific exercise tests
uv run pytest test_exercise_1.py -v
uv run pytest test_exercise_2.py -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest test_exercise_1.py --cov=url_processor --cov-report=term-missing

# Run all exercises
uv run pytest test_exercise_*.py -v
```

## Key Learning Themes

### Progressive Complexity

The exercises build on each other:

1. **Basic Patterns** → Fundamental async testing and pytest usage
2. **Advanced Async** → Complex async patterns and FastMCP specifics
3. **Complex Mocking** → Realistic dependency management
4. **Integration** → Real-world service testing
5. **Quality Focus** → Coverage and maintainability

### Testing Philosophy

Solutions demonstrate:

- **Test Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on meaningful tests
- **Real-World Patterns**: Scenarios you'll encounter in production
- **Maintainable Code**: Tests that are easy to understand and modify
- **Performance Awareness**: Efficient test execution and resource usage

### Async Testing Mastery

Special focus on:

- Proper async/await usage in tests
- Event loop management and timing
- Concurrency testing and control
- Resource cleanup and cancellation handling
