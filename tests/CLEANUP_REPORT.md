# Test Directory Cleanup Report

## Summary

Performed safe cleanup of the tests directory, focusing on removing duplicate and unused imports.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate Imports

- **test_qdrant_integration.py**: Removed duplicate `import os` (line 12)

### 2. Removed Unused Imports  

- **test_database_interface.py**: Removed unused `Optional` from typing imports

### 3. Files Analyzed But Not Modified

- **mcp_test_utils.py**: Kept - actively used by test_mcp_qdrant_integration.py
- ****init**.py**: Kept - required for Python package structure and relative imports
- Other test files: No duplicate or obviously unused imports found

## Statistics

- Total test files: 20
- Files modified: 2
- Lines of code cleaned: 2
- Empty files kept (required): 1 (**init**.py)

## Validation

All changes were minimal and safe:

- Only removed clearly duplicate or unused imports
- Preserved all functionality
- Maintained Python package structure
- No risky refactoring performed

## Next Steps (if aggressive cleanup desired)

- Analyze test coverage to identify potentially unused test files
- Check for redundant test implementations across files
- Consolidate similar test utilities
- Remove commented-out code blocks
