## Prerequisites

### Required Services

The integration tests require these services running via Docker:

```bash
# Start all required services
make dev-bg-nobuild

# Or manually with docker-compose
docker compose up -d qdrant searxng valkey
```

### Required Services

- **Qdrant**: Vector database (port 6333)
- **SearXNG**: Search engine (port 8080)
- **Valkey**: Cache (port 6379)

### Optional Services

- **Supabase**: Alternative vector database (requires credentials)
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph (port 7474)

## Running Integration Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start services first
make dev

# Run all integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/integration/ -m e2e
pytest tests/integration/ -m performance
pytest tests/integration/ -m integration
```

### Test Categories

#### End-to-End Workflows (`-m e2e`)

- Basic crawl and search workflow
- RAG query functionality
- Code search workflow  
- Smart crawling
- Error handling
- Performance validation

#### Database Integration (`-m integration`)

- Qdrant connection lifecycle
- Document storage and retrieval
- Concurrent operations
- Large document handling
- Error recovery
- Data consistency
- Factory pattern testing

#### Performance Benchmarks (`-m performance`)

- Batch crawling throughput
- Search operation throughput
- Storage operation throughput
- Single operation latencies
- Cold start performance
- Database size scaling
- Concurrent user simulation
- Memory usage patterns

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Skip slow tests (recommended for development)
pytest tests/integration/ -m "integration and not slow"

# Run with detailed output
pytest tests/integration/ -v -s

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_e2e_workflows_simple.py -v

# Run performance tests only
pytest tests/integration/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Integration tests use these environment variables (set automatically in test environment):

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_TYPE=qdrant
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=""

# Service URLs
SEARXNG_URL=http://localhost:8080
CACHE_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1

# Feature Flags (simplified for testing)
ENHANCED_CONTEXT=false
USE_RERANKING=false
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=false
```

### Supabase Configuration (Optional)

For Supabase integration tests, set these environment variables:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

Without these, Supabase tests will be skipped.

## Performance Targets

The integration tests validate these performance characteristics:

### Latency Targets

- **Single crawl operation**: < 5 seconds
- **Search operation**: < 2 seconds  
- **Document storage**: < 1 second
- **E2E workflow**: < 20 seconds

### Throughput Targets  

- **Crawling throughput**: > 2 URLs/second
- **Search throughput**: > 5 searches/second
- **Storage throughput**: > 5 documents/second

### Resource Limits

- **Memory usage**: < 200MB peak for test workloads
- **Memory per document**: < 500KB average
- **Cold start time**: < 5 seconds for service initialization

## Test Data Management

### Automatic Cleanup

- Tests use isolated test collections/tables
- Automatic cleanup after each test
- No interference between test runs

### Test Data Patterns

- Small documents: ~500 characters
- Large documents: ~5KB+ characters  
- Mixed workloads: Various document sizes
- Realistic content patterns

## Debugging Integration Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Services Not Running**

   ```bash
   # Error: Connection refused
   # Solution: Start Docker services
   make dev
   ```

2. **Port Conflicts**

   ```bash
   # Error: Port already in use
   # Solution: Stop conflicting services
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Slow Performance**

   ```bash
   # Use performance test markers to identify bottlenecks
   pytest tests/integration/ -m performance -v
   ```

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check service health
docker compose ps
docker compose logs qdrant
docker compose logs searxng

# Test specific service connections
curl http://localhost:6333/collections
curl http://localhost:8080/stats

# Run single test with full output
pytest tests/integration/test_e2e_workflows_simple.py::TestEndToEndWorkflows::test_basic_crawl_and_search_workflow -v -s
```

### Log Analysis

Integration tests include detailed logging:

```bash
# Run with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG pytest tests/integration/ -v -s

# Check performance metrics
pytest tests/integration/ -m performance --tb=short
```

## Coverage Impact

Integration tests significantly boost test coverage by validating:

- **Real database operations**: 15-20% coverage increase
- **Complete workflows**: 10-15% coverage increase  
- **Error handling paths**: 5-10% coverage increase
- **Performance critical code**: 5-10% coverage increase

**Estimated total coverage contribution**: 35-55% additional coverage beyond unit tests.

## Contributing

### Adding New Integration Tests

1. **End-to-End Tests**: Add to `test_e2e_workflows_simple.py`
2. **Database Tests**: Add to `test_database_integration.py`
3. **Performance Tests**: Add to `test_performance_benchmarks.py`

### Test Guidelines

- Use `@pytest.mark.integration` for all integration tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.e2e` for workflow tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.performance` for performance tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.slow` for tests that take >10 seconds
- Mock external services, use real local services
- Include performance assertions where appropriate
- Clean up test data automatically

### Fixture Guidelines

- Use session-scoped fixtures for Docker services
- Use function-scoped fixtures for database clients
- Include proper cleanup in fixtures
- Handle service unavailability gracefully

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Update performance targets** as system improves
2. **Review slow tests** and optimize where possible
3. **Monitor resource usage** and adjust limits
4. **Update Docker service versions** in compose file

### Monitoring

Integration tests include built-in monitoring for:

- Test execution time
- Memory usage patterns  
- Service response times
- Error rates and types

Use this data to:

- Identify performance regressions
- Optimize slow operations
- Plan capacity requirements
- Improve error handling
